# Hexagons of 58 Regions from AR6

In the AR6 report of the IPCC, the world is divided into 58 regions, each represented by a hexagon.

This project is adapted from [https://gitlab.com/b-rowlingson/ipcc](https://gitlab.com/b-rowlingson/ipcc), which originally provided hexagons for land and small island regions. Here, I have extended it by incorporating the sea regions as well.
